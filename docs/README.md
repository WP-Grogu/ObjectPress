# ObjectPress
*The OOP way of developing wordpress sites.*

## Why ?

Coding wordpress websites can be very painfull. Why so ? Because wordpres is procedurally developed.  
This library helps you manage your wordpress theme the OOP way.  

ObjectPress introduce into wordpress config files, easy CPT/Taxonomy configuration, Models and so much more.  
If you're familiar with Laravel, you'll love this library.  

It supports out of the box language features, weither you're using [Polylang](https://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/) or [WPML](https://wpml.org/) plugin to manage langs.

**We highly recommend** using the [root.io](https://roots.io) stack, that helps you manage your wordpress sites correctly using composer for plugins, controllers, blade templating and so on. However, ObjectPress is agnostic and can be used on any wordpress install.
