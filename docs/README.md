## What is this package ?

You're a single **freelance developer** or working in a **web agency**, and you're using Wordpress daily. Wordpress back-office is easy to use for your client, and you can add some plugins that brings time-consuming functionnalities into your project. **Great.**  

But somehow, you feel like **Wordpress is missing something**. Where is the ORM ? Where the hell are Controllers ? Why is there procedural everywhere ? **I feel you**. But fear not, ObjectPress will help you to manage your Wordpress app the **Object-Oriented way**.  

ObjectPress is highly inspired by Laravel and therefore includes `illuminate/*` packages. It introduces configuration files, easy Post types and Taxonomies declarations, the Eloquent ORM & Models and so much more.

If you're familiar with Laravel, you'll love this library !   

ObjectPress also supports out of the box translation features, weither you're using [Polylang](https://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/) or [WPML](https://wpml.org/) plugin to manage them. It also fully support Advanced Custom Fields.

**We highly recommend** using the awesome [root.io](https://roots.io) stack (Bedrock + Sage 10), that helps you in the development process of Wordpress sites using composer and a modern stack. However, ObjectPress is an agnostic library and can be used on any Wordpress installation, you only need composer to get started.
