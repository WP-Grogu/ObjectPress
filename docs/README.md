## What is this ?

You're a single **freelance developer** or working in a **web agency**, and you're using Wordpress daily. Wordpress back-office is easy to use for yout client, and you can add some plugins that brings time-consuming functionnalities into our project. **Great.**  

But somehow, you feel like **Wordpress is missing stuff**. Where is the ORM ? Where the hell are the Controllers ? Why is there procedural everywhere ? **I feel you**. But fear not, ObjectPress helps you manage your Wordpress app the **Object-Oriented way**.  

ObjectPress is highly inspired by Laravel and therefore includes `illuminate/*` packages. It introduces configuration files, easy Post types and Taxonomies declarations, the Eloquent ORM & Models and so much more.

If you're familiar with Laravel, you'll love this library !   


> ObjectPress also supports out of the box translation features, weither you're using [Polylang](https://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/) or [WPML](https://wpml.org/) plugin to manage them. It also fully support Advanced Custom Fields.

**We highly recommend** using the [root.io](https://roots.io) stack (Bedrock + Sage 10), that helps you manage your Wordpress sites correctly, using composer to manage plugins, controllers, blade templating and so on.  

However, ObjectPress is agnostic and can be used on any Wordpress installation ! You're completely free to use from a single to all features shipped into ObjectPress.
