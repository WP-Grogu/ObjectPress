## The concept

Developping wordpress websites can be painfull, as default theme template is managed procedurally.

This library helps you to manage your wordpress theme the OOP way.

This library was developped in addition to the root.io [bedrock/sage](https://roots.io) stack, however you can use it outside of this context (even if you probably should).

This library introduce the concept of models in wordpress, and helps you structuring your theme.
